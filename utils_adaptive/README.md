# utils-adaptive - [project-adaptive](https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/panda_controllers/tree/project_adaptive)

Here you can find different classes implemented with casadi library to generalize serial manipulator control, in particolar for the robot Franka Emika Panda.

* `genThunder`: we implemented some classes in OOP to generalize the approach to serial manipulator control, under the point of view of Denavit-Hartenberg parametrization.
* `genYAML`: we manipulate "original" Franka Emika Panda inertial parameters in `inertial.yaml` to create yaml files for Denavit-Hartenberg parametrization and then for the Regressor.
* `generatedFiles`: it contains the files generated from 2 folders above.
* `chrono_test`: it contains the files to compare execution-time of different algorithms.

## Requirements
* If you want to use and/or modify implemented classes you have to install [casadi](https://github.com/casadi/casadi.git) (see [installation](#casadi---from-source)).
* If you want generate yaml file you have to install [yaml-cpp](https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.git) (see [installation](#yaml-cpp---from-zip)).

## Generation of code with casadi
The aim of `genThunder` folder is to generate code useful for robot's control.

The main classes contained in `genThunder` folder are:

* `CasadiObj`: abstract object useful to:
   - convert casadi element to eigen element
   - obtain matrix
   - generate code
   - ...
* `RobKinBasic`: (derived from `CasadiObj`) useful for compute:
   - forward kinematic
   - jacobian.
* `RobKinAdv`: (derived from `RobKinBasic`) useful for compute:
   - derivative of jacobian
   - pseudo-inverve of jacobian
   - derivative of pseudo-inverve of jacobian
   - ... 
* `RobDyn`: (derived from `RobKinBasic`) useful for compute:
   - mass matrix
   - coriolis matrix
   - gravity matrix
* `RobReg`: (derived from `RobKinBasic`) useful for compute:
   - regressor 

## Installation
Steps for installation:

### casadi - from source
   
Before continue check the instructions of installation in the official [API site](https://casadi.sourceforge.net/api/html/d3/def/chapter2.html), [git repostery](https://github.com/casadi/casadi.git) and [website](https://web.casadi.org/).

That are following:

1. Clone the `main` repostery of `casadi`:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/casadi/casadi.git -b main casadi
   ```

1. Set the environment variable `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` to inform CMake where the dependecies are located. For example if headers and libraries are installed under `$HOME/local/`, then type:
   ```
   export CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=$HOME/local/
   ```

1. Make install
   ```
   cd casadi; mkdir build; cd build
   cmake ..
   ccmake ..
   make
   make install
   ```

### yaml-cpp - from .zip

Before continue follow installation instruction from repostery https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp.

That are following:

1. Download local clone .zip from https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp and extract.
1. Navigate into the source directory and run:
   ```
   mkdir build; cd build
   cmake ..
   cmake --build .
   make
   sudo make install
   ```
